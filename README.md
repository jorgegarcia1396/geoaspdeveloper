# Geospatial ASP.NET Developer

This ASP.NET Web application demonstrates the use of geospatial JavaScript libraries for reporting financial, energy, and other analytical data.

I am an ASP.NET Web Application Developer. Lately I have been occupied with building GIS mapping applications. I really enjoy reporting any type of analytic, metric, or diagnostic data geospatially.

I like to take software components or utilities and combine them to build applications. My development strengths reside in the ability to take separate software packages and make them work together to create higher level information systems. In this Web application, I used OpenLayers mapping library and jQWidgets for UI visualization as the base building blocks for the pages.

I am also recently enrolled in the [Master of Applied Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies](https://magist.gis.ucla.edu/) (MAGIST) program provided by UCLA. In this program I am learning a lot of new technology and techniques for processing and analyzing geospatial data, which I hope to use in my current employment.
